### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
      My name is Luka Djordjevic i am a student at Faculty Of Tehnical Sciences attendig a 4 year program called "Software engineering and information technologies".
      I have worked on many projects which are not yet posted on my github profile because i was not asked to by my professors back then in my first year of studies.
      I am aiming to post them here by the end of summer. 
      Projects i have worked on that are here are gettin more and more serious. My team has recently finished a project where we were making a healthcare informational         system, as well as another project where we made a wpf app for toll station system.
